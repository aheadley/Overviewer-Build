This is the distributed build system for Minecraft-Overviewer.

Running `worker.py` will launch a Gearman worker that will fetch,
build and upload Overviewer packages on command. Usually these
commands come in the form of a `!build` command issued in the
#overviewer IRC channel.

`worker.py` will autodetect what system you are on, and act
accordingly. Currently supported systems are Windows, Debian, and
OSX. Of course, you will need to be able to compile and run
Overviewer, but you will also need a few extra things.

 * `git` is used to fetch the packages. You must have it.

 * `python-gearman` to communicate with the master gearman server. Use
   eminence's `testing` branch to prevent most random disconnections:
    
   https://github.com/eminence/python-gearman/tree/testing

 * The build system password, in either `secret_key.txt` or the
   `SECRET_KEY` environment variable. If you're setting up a build
   machine, this will be provided to you.
 
 * Some way of uploading, somewhere. Currently included uploaders are
   for an S3 account and for overviewer.org. The overviewer.org
   uploader needs an SSH key, which can be provided if you're setting
   up a build machine.

Depending on the system, some extra things may be needed that aren't
listed here. Debian, for instance, needs the debian package tools
installed.

This may or may not be useful to anyone else, or even anyone at all. YMMV.
